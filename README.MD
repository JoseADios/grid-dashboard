# 🚀 Dashboard Project - The Odin Project

## 📝 Description

This repository contains my final project for the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course from The Odin Project. The project involves creating a dashboard using CSS Grid. The dashboard includes a search bar, a notification bell, and a user profile section.

## 🎨 Styling

The styling of the dashboard is done using CSS. The search bar (#bar) has a custom style and changes color when focused. The user container (.user-cont) is designed using CSS Grid. The user profile image (.perfil-img) is styled to be circular and has a custom size.
